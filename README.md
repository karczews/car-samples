Car Samples Repository
==================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get started
writing apps for the car.

The samples are categorized by the libraries they use to integrate with the car:
- Car App Library - The library that allows developers to build navigation, parking,
and charging apps for the Android Auto-compatible cars. The app may be running in
a phone connected to the car or in the Android Automotive OS running in the car.

- Android Automotive OS - Android-based infotainment system that is built in to vehicles.
The car's system is a stand-alone Android device that is optimized for driving.
